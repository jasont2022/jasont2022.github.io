          Chunk out studying hours into 1 to 3 hours for each subject each day,

        <h3 class="qa-question">2. Which assignments should I start or prioritize first?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          Prioritize on assignments that make you feel comfortable when you finish them.
          For example, start with easy ones to get out of the way or hard ones to feel settled.

        <h3 class="qa-question">3. I'm feeling burnt out from my studies, what should I do?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          It's probably because you are not allowing yourself to recharge or take longer breaks.
          Have a longer period of downtime on which day of the week to recharge and avoid burnt out.
          On your downtime, do something that you enjoy doing besides academics like running, playing video games,
          or hang out with friends. Please take care of yourself.
