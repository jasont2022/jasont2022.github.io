        <h3 class="qa-question">3. I'm feeling burnt out from my studies, what should I do?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          It's probably because you are not allowing yourself to recharge or take longer breaks.
          Have a longer period of downtime on which day of the week to recharge and avoid burnt out.
          On your downtime, do something that you enjoy doing besides academics like running, playing video games,
          or hang out with friends. Please take care of yourself.

        <h3 class="qa-question">1. What should I do when I am not getting the most of my classes?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          The possible answer could be that you are not picking a major or set of classes that excites you the most. To
          get the most of your classes,
          pick classes that you are passionate in learning and you will feel the most achievable or happy with the
          results you end up with.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-content" id="qa-2">
        <h3 class="qa-question">2. What should I do when I am struggling with this one class and I just want to get it
          over with it?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          The first sugesstion for you is to decide whether this class is important to your success in terms of learning
          or career wise. This will
          determine if you can just drop or pass the class if it is not a requirement or something important to your
          studies. If this class
          is important to your studies like a mandatory requirement, it would not hurt to talk to the professor. The
          professor can help you with
          your studies, guide you through the class, and even provide useful advices on how to struggle less with the
          class.
          The professor is responsible for the content or materials for the class and they in the end determine your
          grades.

      <div class="qa-content" id="qa-3">
        <h3 class="qa-question">3. Why are my grades are not reflecting my best effort I put into my classes?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          The grades from your classes consist of multiple aspects such as homework, projects, midterms, particaption,
          etc. Most likely you are
          receving low grades with one or more aspects in the class. The best advice is to realize where you are
          struggling with and to find ways
          to improve on that aspect. You can also discuss with your professors to see why your effort is not being
          reflected in your grade. For example,
          one might be extremely successful in homework, but is struggling with exams. This could be not studying for
          exams, spending less time doing
          practice exam questions, or not holding one self to truly understand the class materials.
        </p>

      <div class="qa-content" id="qa-4">
        <h3 class="qa-question">4. What should I do when I feel completely lost or clueless about what I am learning in
          my classes?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          The first suggestion for you is to talk to the professor of the classes you feel completely lost. They help
          you catch up with the speed of the class or even provide extensions on work if nessecary. The professor of the
          class can provide useful tips for you to
          succeed in thier classes. The second suggestion is to attend office hours of the professor or TAs as they can
          always help answer your questions in class materials or homework.

      <div class="qa-content" id="qa-5">
        <h3 class="qa-question">5. What should I do when the pace of my classes are fast and I am extremely behind?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          Same as above, the suggestion would be for you to talk to the professor of the class as they determine the
          pace and materials of the class. They can provide advice in terms of which materials or assignments to
          priortize and provide extensions if needed.

      <div class="qa-content" id="qa-6">
        <h3 class="qa-question">6. How do I "make time" for myself to do anything besides studying all the time?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          One suggestion would be to find some days of the week to recharge or have a longer period of downtime.
          On your downtime, do something that you enjoy besides academics and do not think about your work, enjoy the
          time you have spent on your break. This will prevent burnt out and to feel recharge. Everyone has the same 24
          hours, no one has extra hours. So, be wise with the time you spend doing, in this case, enjoying your break!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-content" id="qa-7">
        <h3 class="qa-question">7. Why do I feel unmotivated to continue my studies or even putting in effort into my
          classes?</h3>
        <p class="qa-answer">
          There are many possibilities with this question. One possibility could be that you are burnt out for your
          classes. Another could be
          that you are not enojoying or learning as much from your classes. With these possibilities, the suggestion
          would be to reflect why
          you are feeling this way and to figure out your answer. Also, it would not hurt to seek out help and to
          discuss your feelings with ours.
          If your answer is to the disucssions above check it out! The most important take away from this, is that you
          are feeling passionate about
          what you are doing and that you are taking care of yourself.
